# Binary Search Tree

## Functionalities:

- insert(val):                  inserts a new node into tree
- search(val):                  returns True if a value is present in the tree
- update(val, new_val):         updates the first occurance of given value to the new value
- delete(val):                  deletes the node with the given value
- preorder_traversal():         Gives the nodes in the order of Node - Left_subtree - Right_subtree
- inorder_traversal():          Gives the sorted order of values

## Unit Tests:

- Tests the usage of insertion and inorder traversals.
- Tests the usage of updation, deletion and search operations.



- Note: Avoided recursion in all the functionalities as per task requirements
